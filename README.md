# Microservices Application with Django REST APIs, Docker, and AWS ECS Deployment

## Overview

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using Django REST APIs, Docker, and AWS ECS for deployment. The application consists of several services:

- **auth_service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **posts_service**: Handles CRUD operations for posts.
- **likes_service**: Manages likes on posts.
- **comments_service**: Manages comments on posts.
- **frontend**: A simple frontend to interact with the services.

## Implemented REST APIs

Each Django service is implemented as a REST API using Django REST Framework (DRF). Here is an outline of the main endpoints for each service:

### Auth Service API

| Endpoint                 | HTTP Method | Description                    |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `/api/auth/register`     | POST        | Register a new user            |
| `/api/auth/login`        | POST        | Authenticate a user            |
| `/api/auth/logout`       | POST        | Logout the current user        |
| `/api/auth/users`        | GET         | Retrieve list of users         |

### Posts Service API

| Endpoint                 | HTTP Method | Description                    |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `/api/posts/`            | GET         | List all posts                 |
| `/api/posts/`            | POST        | Create a new post              |
| `/api/posts/<id>`        | GET         | Retrieve a specific post       |
| `/api/posts/<id>`        | PUT         | Update a post                  |
| `/api/posts/<id>`        | DELETE      | Delete a post                  |

### Likes Service API

| Endpoint                        | HTTP Method | Description                      |
|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `/api/likes/`                   | GET         | List all likes                   |
| `/api/likes/like/<post_id>`     | POST        | Like a specific post             |
| `/api/likes/unlike/<post_id>`   | POST        | Unlike a specific post           |

### Comments Service API

| Endpoint                        | HTTP Method | Description                          |
|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/api/comments/`                | GET         | List all comments                    |
| `/api/comments/<post_id>`       | POST        | Add a comment to a specific post     |
| `/api/comments/<id>`            | DELETE      | Delete a comment                     |

## Dockerizing the Microservices

Each microservice is containerized using Docker. The following steps outline the Dockerization process for each service.

### Step 1: Create Dockerfile for Each Service

Each service has a `Dockerfile` that includes:

```dockerfile
# Base Image
FROM python:3.12

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy project files
COPY . /app/

# Expose service port
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the Django server
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "projectname.wsgi:application"]
```

### Step 2: Build and Tag Docker Images

Build the Docker image for each service:

```bash
docker build -t auth_service ./auth_service
docker build -t posts_service ./posts_service
docker build -t likes_service ./likes_service
docker build -t comments_service ./comments_service
docker build -t frontend ./frontend
```

### Step 3: Run Containers Locally for Testing

Set up a Docker network and run each container to verify functionality:

```bash
docker network create mynetwork

docker run -d --network mynetwork --name auth_service -p 8001:8000 auth_service
docker run -d --network mynetwork --name posts_service -p 8002:8000 posts_service
docker run -d --network mynetwork --name likes_service -p 8003:8000 likes_service
docker run -d --network mynetwork --name comments_service -p 8004:8000 comments_service
docker run -d --network mynetwork --name frontend -p 8080:80 frontend
```

## Setting Up AWS ECS

AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) is used to deploy and manage these microservices in a scalable and resilient manner.

### Step 1: Push Docker Images to AWS ECR

Set up ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repositories for each service, then push your Docker images.

1. **Create ECR Repositories**:
   - Go to **ECR** in AWS Console, create repositories for each service (`auth_service`, `posts_service`, etc.).

2. **Push Docker Images to ECR**:

   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
   docker tag auth_service <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/auth_service
   docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/auth_service
   # Repeat for each service
   ```

### Step 2: Define Task Definitions

In the AWS ECS Console, create task definitions for each service with the appropriate configuration, including:

- **Image URI** (from ECR)
- **Port Mappings**
- **Environment Variables** (if needed)
- **Networking Mode**: Use **AWS VPC**.

### Step 3: Create ECS Cluster and Services

1. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Go to **Clusters** in ECS, create a new cluster.

2. **Create Services**:
   - For each microservice, create a new ECS service, specifying the task definition created above.

## Deploying the Application on ECS

After setting up the task definitions and services, deploy your services by starting the ECS cluster. AWS ECS will handle service deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

## Testing and Accessing the Application

Once deployed, you can access the services via the load balancer or individual service endpoints (depending on your ECS setup). You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to test each endpoint:

```bash
curl http://<load-balancer-dns>/api/auth/register -d '{"username": "test", "password": "test123"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Additional Configurations

### ALLOWED_HOSTS and Networking

In each Django serviceâ€™s settings, ensure that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes the ECS service name or load balancer domain.

### Environment Variables

Use ECS environment variable settings to manage sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret keys.
